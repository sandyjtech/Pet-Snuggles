## Introduction

Pet Snuggles is a demo application for a service where people can schedule times for a cat or dog to be dropped off for snuggle time.

### As a user I can:

* Login to account.

* See more details of a selected pet.

* Schedule a snuggle time.

* Click a link to adopt a pet.

* Favorite pets.

* View profile.

* Check schedule for previously scheduled snuggles.


## Roadmap

Ideas for future releases:

- Search function working.
- Having the database linked to petfinder.com so it updates across the two platforms. 
- With the linked database we'd add a search for pets in your area. 

## Contributing

Open to contributions. Reach out if you'd like to contribute, we'd love to hear your ideas! For your suggestions on making this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request.
