# Pet Snuggles
NEED TO UPDATE: To run, clone down, run npm install, json-server --watch db.json, then npm start.

## Introduction

Pet Snuggles is a demo application for a service where people can schedule times for a cat or dog to be dropped off for snuggle time.

### As a user I can:

* Login to account.

* Search for dogs or cats.

* See more details of a selected pet.

* Schedule a snuggle time.

* Click a link to adopt a pet.

* Favorite pets.

* View profile.

* Check schedule for previously scheduled snuggles.


## Roadmap

Ideas for future releases:

- Having the database linked to petfinder.com so it updates across the two platforms. 
- With the linked database we'd add a search for pets in your area. 

## Contributing
